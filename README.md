This repository contains short projects made in courses "Matrix and Tensor Methods in Data Analysis" and "Advanced Linear and Non-linear Numerical Methods in Data Analysis" during the year 2022./23. in collaboration with one or two other students.

Each project consists of the documentation PDF file and a folder, which then contains the implementation and papers that inspired the corresponding short project in the first place.
